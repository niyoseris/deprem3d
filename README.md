# Earthquake 3D Visualization

This project is a web-based application that visualizes earthquake data in a 3D environment using CesiumJS. Users can filter earthquakes based on various parameters, including magnitude, depth, and time range.

## Features
- Visualize earthquake data in real-time.
- Filter earthquakes by magnitude, depth, and date range.
- Interactive 3D map using CesiumJS.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Flask) for the backend.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.
- CesiumJS for 3D visualization.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/niyoseris/deprem3d.git
   cd deprem3d
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

## Usage
- Use the filter form to specify the parameters for the earthquakes you want to visualize.
- Adjust the map view to see different areas and the corresponding earthquake data.
